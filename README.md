2. User Stories
• As a frequent shopper, I want to save my preferred payment method, so that I can checkout faster.
• As a new user, I want to filter products by price, brand, and rating, so that I can find relevant items quickly.
• As a busy customer, I want to use one-tap checkout, so that I can complete purchases instantly.
• As a price-sensitive user, I want to see discounts clearly, so that I can choose the best deals.
• As a returning customer, I want to reorder previously bought items, so that I can save time.
3. Scenario Narrative
Riya, a 27-year-old software engineer, is browsing the shopping app during her tea break. She needs new earphones and wants to buy them quickly. With little time and a noisy environment, she uses the 'One-Tap Buy' button because her address and payment details are already saved. She completes the purchase in under 30 seconds and feels relieved.
